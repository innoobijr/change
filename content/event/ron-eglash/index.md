abstract: 'Contemporary disasters -- racism, environmental destruction, labor exploitation, platforms that colonize our social networks, and so on -- have one feature in common: they are all examples of value that is extracted; that is, alienated from its generative source. Computational technologies can be designed to act as prosthetics for this wounded body politic: restoring the ability to generate and circulate value rather than extract it. Supported by an NSF “Future of Work” grant, we report on some initial experiments in developing methods, techniques and strategies in the design of these technologies for generative justice.'
