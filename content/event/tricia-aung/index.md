abstract: Advancements in data collection and pressure for data-driven accountability has created vast amounts of health data in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). Visualizing global health data can be a powerful advocacy strategy, but also can be weaponized to reinforce epistemic injustice and exacerbate systemic harms. This talk will review my experiences leading research and workshops on global health data visualization preferences and sensemaking for decision-makers in LMICs.
