abstract: 'Enthusiasm for using human-centered design persists among HCI and ICTD  researchers and practitioners; funding agencies continue to support efforts to use this design strategy in development projects. However, few—if any—of these projects reach their potential. Given that most of these projects fail researchers and practitioners might consider adopting different approaches to design. In this talk, I will offer “irrational design” as an alternative to human-centered design. This approach draws from 15+ years of studying technology use in sub-Saharan Africa, in (primarily Kenyan) sites, as well as my training as an industrial designer. In particular, I will present three case studies detailing my use of these design methods in research conducted in rural Kenya: cultural probes, speculative design, and design workbooks. My findings raise questions about generalizability, objectivity, and the pursuit of a single solution in design. These findings also draw attention to different ways for people to participate in design processes, and to the value of long-term engagement with communities.'
