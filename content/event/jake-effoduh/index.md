event: Change seminar

location: CSE 271 (Gates Building), Bill and Melinda Gates Building | [Zoom](https://washington.zoom.us/j/93100061611)
address:
  street: 185 E Stevens Way NE
  city: Seattle
  region: WA
  postcode: '98195'
  country: United States

abstract: "Self-driving cars as a mode of transportation in Africa is probably more of a ‘when’ than an ‘if’ question. These autonomous vehicles that could benefit human safety by reducing human deaths from car crashes, may disadvantage Africans if the production of the technology does not adequately reflect African perspectives, including in the ethical constructions about rulemaking."
